/**
 * Just figuring out WTF we want to do here ATM
 */

// Setup canvas stuff (probably w/Kontra)

// have some sort of render loop which can rotate the logo or something cool

// canvas.draw menu stuff:
// big logo/splash message

// menu buttons <ul> (but with canvas so not an <ul> I think)

// when keyPressed 'down' or 'up' highlight menu item with diff color or somethin

// when enter pressed, go to options scene, or ship-picking scene

// have some way of getting back to the main menu scene!
