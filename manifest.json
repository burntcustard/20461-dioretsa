  "description": "Named after the damocloid, (and Asteroids... backwards) 20461 Dioretsa is a local multiplayer Asteroids-like. Each of the 4 spaceships include a 'flash back' drive [down arrow or 'S'], which lets you 'travel back in time' to get back to your previous location. And they have different hitboxes, physics properties, and stats! There's AI that will attack Player 1, so you can play singleplayer versus 1-3 AI. Supports one player with [WASD/QZSD, E, X], one with [ARROW KEYS, SPACE, ESC], and 1-4 gamepads. Nintendo Joy-Cons have mapped keys (and even attempt to match colours when connected), but other controllers aren't garunteed to work. Includes advanced collision detection via a Collisions library by sinova, realistic circle-based elastic physics with calculations based on pi2.js, sounds via ZzFX, and a custom Path2D-based font.",
