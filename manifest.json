  "description": "Named after the ... 20461 dioretsa is a local multiplayer Asteroids-like. There's AI that will attack PLayer 1, so you can play singleplayer versus 1-3 AI. Supports one player with [WASD/QZSD, E, X], one with [ARROW KEYS, SPACE, ESC], and 1-4 gamepads. Nintendo Joy-Cons have mapped keys (and even attempt to match colours when connected), but other controllers aren't garunteed to work as intended. The game includes advanced collisions via the Collisions library by sinova, and realistic circle non-momentum-loosing physics based roughly based on Circles.js. Each of the 4 spaceships have different hitboxes, physics properties and stats (Although some had to be merged to save space!)",
